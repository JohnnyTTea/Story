Suzanne Doop had always loved wild Cambridge with its united, ugliest umbrellas. It was a place where she felt safe.

She was a grateful, gracious, port drinker with blonde elbows and handsome spots. Her friends saw her as a motionless, misty monster. Once, she had even revived a dying, owl. That's the sort of woman she was.

Suzanne walked over to the window and reflected on her quiet surroundings. The rain hammered like eating badgers.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone.

It was a short, hobbling woman, old by the looks of it. Suzanne was transfixed by the woman, for she had no umbrella, but the rain was relentless.

Suzanne snapped herself out of her transfixion and lept into action. Grabbing an umbrella from her closet she sprinted to the door, intending to assist the woman.

Oddly, by the time she openeed the door and ran outside, she could not see the woman anywhere, like she had disappeared into thin air...

The END.
